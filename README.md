# Smart-bin
A smart dustbin system using an Arduino, servo motor, two ultrasonic sensors, and an LCD. The system opens the dustbin lid when a person is near and closes it when they leave. It also detects if the dustbin is full using the second ultrasonic sensor and displays the status on the LCD. The bin doesn't open when it's full.
